### **1. Introduction**
The rental bike emerged strongly in 2020 during the pandemic, when people started to seek safer and more flexible ways to move around the city. Since then, it has become helpful among students and then among business professionals who value more convenience and sustainability options. Additionally, tourism and seasonal factors, especially the summer season, were key drivers of rental demand. Moreover, tourism destinations encourage renting and driving around the city as another way to do a personal tour. More cities are becoming greener in transportation, and rental companies wanting to develop and expand their business must keep an eye on rental trends. By aligning their strategies with these evolving consumer preferences and environmental shifts, companies can position themselves for long-term growth and consider expanding into emerging markets such as Latin America.
